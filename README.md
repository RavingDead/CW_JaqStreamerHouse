READ ME BEFORE DOWNLOAD. Content Warning modpack for my friends. You know who you are üëÅÔ∏è   üëÅÔ∏è

## Before you download
In order to use Virality/Self_Sufficient (or more than 4 multiplayer), the host will need to update their configuration for Self_Sufficient with the proper APPIds.

Why is this not included in the modpack? If it was, other people could take this ID for their own usage, which might end up slowing down or breaking the servers for me and my friends.

If you know me, ping me for the APPIDs. Otherwise, I recommend this video for setting this up for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmyiFDInYaU

(Technically, only the host needs this in order for it to work for everybody. But in practice, if different people host or the main host isn't there it's better that everyone does this.)

## Description
This aims to make a few additions to the game without being too intrusive.

This modpack also includes preset configurations.
